Step 6: Write a Sample Program

Now that gcc compiler is installed, it is time to write a sample C program to test the compiler

root@DESKTOP-623DOIP:~# nano hello1.c

#include<stdio.h>

void main()

{

printf("Hello Ubunto\n");

}

To compile the above program

root@DESKTOP-623DOIP:~# gcc -o hello1 hello1.c

Then you can run the program by using

root@DESKTOP-623DOIP:~# ./hello1

Hello Ubunto
